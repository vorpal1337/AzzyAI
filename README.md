# AzzyAI-Fork for kRO Homunculus Update

This is not the official AzzyAI but a fork.
For the original repository please refer to: https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AzzyAI

For more information, see the official website: http://drazzy.com/ro/ai

## Versions
Currently, there are two versions of this AI:
### [Main](https://github.com/Kisaro/AzzyAI/archive/master.zip)
This branch attempts to be close to vanilla azzyai without further modifications except introducing the skill-changes below. **Pick this version if you want to be as close to vanilla azzyai as possible and like tinkering with the settings.**
### [Custom](https://github.com/Kisaro/AzzyAI/archive/custom-settings.zip)
Contains everything above, plus some personal adjustments to auto-cast some skills and modifications to cooldowns to aim for 100% uptime of various buffs. **Pick this version if you want an AI tailored to Amistr+Dieter out of the box.**

## Install ##
 - Download a version ([main](https://github.com/Kisaro/AzzyAI/archive/master.zip) or [custom](https://github.com/Kisaro/AzzyAI/archive/custom-settings.zip)) of your choice from above
 - Open the downloaded ZIP-file
 - Navigate to your Ragnarok-folder
 - Copy the *USER_AI*-folder from the ZIP-file into the *AI*-folder of your Ragnarok-folder (will overwrite the currently installed user-AI, make backups!)
